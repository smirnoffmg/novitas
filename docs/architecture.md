# Novitas Architecture

## Overview

Novitas is a self-improving AI multi-agent system that autonomously enhances its own codebase, tests, documentation, and configuration through daily improvement cycles.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Orchestrator Agent
- **Role**: Central coordinator and decision maker
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage agent lifecycle (create, monitor, retire)
  - Coordinate improvement cycles
  - Evaluate and select change proposals
  - Maintain system evolution strategy

#### 2. Specialized Agents
- **Code Agent**: Analyzes and improves code quality, performance, and maintainability
- **Test Agent**: Enhances test coverage, reliability, and effectiveness
- **Documentation Agent**: Improves documentation quality and completeness

#### 3. Database Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store for agent states, cycles, and proposals
- **Redis**: Caching and message broker for inter-agent communication

#### 4. External Services
- **OpenAI API**: LLM provider for agent reasoning and code generation
- **GitHub API**: Repository management and pull request creation

## Data Flow

### Daily Improvement Cycle

1. **Initialization**
   - Load agent states from database
   - Initialize LLM clients and external services
   - Create improvement cycle record

2. **Agent Execution**
   - Orchestrator selects active agents
   - Each agent analyzes assigned components
   - Agents generate change proposals with confidence scores

3. **Proposal Evaluation**
   - Orchestrator evaluates all proposals
   - Selects highest-scoring proposals
   - Resolves conflicts and dependencies

4. **Implementation**
   - Create feature branch
   - Apply selected changes
   - Run tests and quality checks
   - Create pull request with reasoning

5. **State Persistence**
   - Save cycle results
   - Update agent performance metrics
   - Archive retired agents

## Agent Evolution

### Genetic Algorithm Approach

1. **Performance Tracking**
   - Monitor agent success rates
   - Track proposal acceptance rates
   - Measure code quality improvements

2. **Selection Pressure**
   - Retire underperforming agents
   - Archive their states for analysis
   - Create new agents with evolved prompts

3. **Evolution Mechanisms**
   - Prompt mutation and crossover
   - Role specialization
   - Strategy adaptation

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- **Linting**: Code style and quality
- **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
- **Coverage**: Maintain minimum coverage thresholds
- **Security**: Vulnerability scanning

### Human Review
- **Pull Request Review**: Human oversight of AI changes
- **Reasoning Documentation**: Clear explanations for all changes
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert problematic changes

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Agent Pool**: Multiple instances of each agent type
- **Database Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple databases
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute improvement cycles across nodes

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking agent execution
- **Resource Limits**: Timeout and memory constraints

## Security Model

### Access Control
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of external API keys
- **Repository Permissions**: Limited GitHub access scope
- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections and access controls

### Data Protection
- **Agent State Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action logging for transparency
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **Agent Performance**: Success rates, execution times
- **System Health**: Database connections, API response times
- **Business Metrics**: Improvement cycle success rates

### Logging Strategy
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with context
- **Log Levels**: Configurable verbosity
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log collection and analysis

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Manage multiple codebases
- **Advanced Agent Types**: Specialized agents for specific domains
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Learn from human feedback
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Human-AI pair programming

### Research Areas
- **Prompt Engineering**: Automated prompt optimization
- **Agent Communication**: Advanced inter-agent protocols
- **Decision Making**: Improved proposal evaluation algorithms
