### 🧠 Agent Communication Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Message Flow"
        ORCH[Orchestrator] --> REDIS[Redis Pub/Sub]
        REDIS --> AGENT1[Code Agent]
        REDIS --> AGENT2[Test Agent] 
        REDIS --> AGENT3[Doc Agent]
        AGENT1 --> REDIS
        AGENT2 --> REDIS  
        AGENT3 --> REDIS
        REDIS --> ORCH
    end
    
    subgraph "Persistence"
        ORCH --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        AGENT1 --> DB
        AGENT2 --> DB
        AGENT3 --> DB
    end
```

**Key Design Principles:**

- **Hub-and-Spoke**: All agents communicate through orchestrator only
- **Message-Based**: Async pub/sub for scalability  
- **State Persistence**: Full state snapshots for recovery
- **Event Sourcing**: All actions logged for analysis

## 🛠️ Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 🔧 Challenge 1: Agent Coordination
**Problem**: Preventing conflicts when multiple agents propose changes to the same code.

**Solution**: 
- Orchestrator-mediated communication only
- File-level locking during change application
- Semantic conflict detection using AST analysis
- Change scoring and prioritization system

### 🔧 Challenge 2: Quality Assurance  
**Problem**: Ensuring agent-generated changes don't break the system.

**Solution**:

- Static analysis and security scanning
- Gradual rollback capability
- Human review requirement for high-risk changes

### 🔧 Challenge 3: Agent Learning
**Problem**: How agents learn from past successes and failures.

**Solution**:
- Event sourcing for all agent actions
- Success/failure feedback loops
- Prompt optimization based on outcomes
- Performance metric tracking per agent

### 🔧 Challenge 4: Scalability
**Problem**: System performance with many agents and large codebases.

**Solution**:
- Async-first architecture throughout
- Redis for fast message passing
- Database connection pooling
- Incremental analysis for large codebases

3. ✅ Generate and apply code improvements
4. ✅ Create pull requests with human-readable reasoning
5. ✅ Pass all quality gates (tests, linting, security)

### 🏆 Success Metrics
- **Functional**: 90% of daily sessions complete successfully
- **Quality**: All generated PRs pass CI checks
- **Value**: At least 50% of generated PRs get merged
- **Performance**: Complete session in under 30 minutes

## 🤔 Key Decisions to Make

### 1. **LLM Provider Strategy**
- **Option A**: OpenAI only (simpler, proven)
- **Option B**: Multi-provider with fallbacks (resilient, expensive)
- **Recommendation**: Start with OpenAI, add providers later

### 2. **Agent Persistence**
- **Option A**: Full state snapshots (simple, potentially large)
- **Option B**: Event sourcing (complex, complete audit trail)
- **Recommendation**: Full state snapshots initially, migrate to events later

### 3. **Change Conflict Resolution**  
- **Option A**: First-come-first-served (simple, potentially unfair)
- **Option B**: Scoring-based selection (fair, requires complex scoring)
- **Recommendation**: Hybrid approach with file-level locks and scoring

### 4. **Deployment Model**
- **Option A**: Single repository self-improvement (focused)
- **Option B**: Multi-repository coordination (scalable, complex)
- **Recommendation**: Single repository MVP, multi-repo as Phase 6
